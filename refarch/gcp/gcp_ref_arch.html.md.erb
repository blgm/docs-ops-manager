This topic describes two reference architectures for <%= vars.ops_manager %> and any runtime products, including <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>), on Google Cloud Platform (GCP): on a shared virtual private cloud (VPC) and on a single-project VPC. This topic also outlines multiple networking variants for VPC deployment. The architectures are validated for production-grade <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployments using multiple availability zones (AZs).

For general requirements for running <%= vars.ops_manager %> and specific requirements for running <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP, see [<%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP Requirements](../../install/gcp.html)


## <a id="refarchs"></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> Reference Architectures

An <%= vars.ops_manager %> reference architecture describes a proven approach for deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> on a specific IaaS, such as GCP.

An <%= vars.ops_manager %> reference architecture must meet these requirements:

* Be secure
* Be publicly accessible
* Include common <%= vars.ops_manager %>-managed services such as VMware Tanzu SQL, VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ, and Spring Cloud Services for VMware Tanzu
* Be able to host at least 100 app instances

<%= vars.company_name %> provides reference architectures to help you determine the best configuration for your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.


## <a id="shared-vs-single"></a> Shared vs Single-Project VPCs

A shared VPC installation is harder to configure than an <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment on a single-project VPC, because the required account privileges and resource allocations are more granular and complex. But the shared VPC architecture allows network assets to be centrally located, which simplifies auditing and security. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends the shared VPC model for:

* Deployments with deep auditing and security requirements
* When networks hosting the foundation need to connect back to an internal network through a VPN or interconnect

A single-project VPC lets the platform architect give <%= vars.ops_manager %> full access to the VPC and its resources, which makes configuration easier. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends single-project VPC architecture for:

* Standalone deployments that do not connect to an internal network
* Test and experimental deployments, and for projects which do not belong to an organization


## <a id="shared-vpc"></a> Shared VPC GCP Reference Architecture

The diagram below illustrates a reference architecture for a deployment of <%= vars.ops_manager %> on a shared VPC on GCP. This architecture requires an organization on the VPC that contains a host project and a service project.

### <a id="shared-vpc-nat"></a> NAT Network Topology

To expose a minimal number of public IP addresses, set up your NAT as shown in the diagram below:

<%= image_tag('../images/gcp-nat-flow.png', :alt => "Complex diagram. For more information, see other sections.") %>

### <a id="shared-vpc-interconnect"></a> Cloud Interconnect

To speed communication between data centers, use Google Cloud Interconnect, as shown in the diagram below:

<%= image_tag('../images/gcp-cloud-interconnect.png', :alt => "Diagram described below.") %>

<a href="../images/gcp-cloud-interconnect.png" aria-hidden="true">View a larger version of this diagram</a>

The diagram shows two customer networks in GCP. One shows the traditional setup of linking to the VPN Gateway through the Customer Gateway. The other setup shows Customer Gateway connecting to Cloud Interconnect instead of VPN Gateway. The gateway then connects to the Cloud Router, which goes to each of the three subnetworks.

### <a id="host-service"></a> Host and Service Architecture

GCP allocates resources using a hierarchy that centers around projects. To create a VPC, architects define a _host project_ that allocates network resources for the VPC, such as address space and firewall rules. Then they can define one or more _service projects_ to run within the VPC, which share the network resources allocated by the host project and include their own non-network resources, such as VMs and storage buckets.

To install <%= vars.ops_manager %>, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), and services in a shared VPC on GCP, you create a host project for the VPC and a service project dedicated to running <%= vars.ops_manager %>, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, and services.

#### <a id="host-resources"></a> Host Project Resources

The host project centrally manages these shared VPC network resources:

* Infra subnet (<%= vars.ops_manager %> VM and BOSH Director)
* <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> subnet
* Services subnet
* Isolation segments
* Firewall rules
* NAT instances and gateway
* VPN or Google Cloud Interconnect
* Routes, such as egress Internet through NAT or egress on-premises through a VPN

#### <a id="service-resources"></a> Service Project Resources

The service project manages these resources:

* Google Cloud Compute instances (VMs)
    * BOSH Director
    * <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM
    * VMs deployed by BOSH, such as runtime and service components

* Google Cloud Storage buckets for blobstore
    * BOSH Director
    * Resources
    * Buildpacks
    * Droplets
    * Packages

* Service account and a service account key for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to access the storage buckets

* A service account for <%= vars.ops_manager %>

* Load balancers

* Google Cloud SQL instances, if using external databases


## <a id="single-vpc"></a> Single-Project VPC Base GCP Reference Architecture

The diagram below illustrates a reference architecture for a deployment of <%= vars.ops_manager %> on a single-project [VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc) on GCP.

<%= image_tag('../images/gcp-overview-single-vpc.png', :alt => "Diagram of GCP Reference Architecture. Components listed in the following section.") %>

<a href="../images/gcp-overview-single-vpc.png" aria-hidden="true">View a larger version of this diagram</a>

### <a id="base_components"></a> Base Reference Architecture Components

The table below lists the components that are part of a reference architecture deployment with three AZs.

| **Component** | **Reference Architecture Notes** |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Domains and DNS** | Domain zones and routes in use by the reference architecture include: domains for *.apps and *.system (required), a route for <%= vars.ops_manager %> (required), a route for Doppler (required), a route for Loggregator (required), a route for SSH access to app containers (optional), and a route for TCP routing to apps (optional). Reference architecture uses GCP Cloud DNS as the DNS provider. |
| **<%= vars.ops_manager %> VM** | Deployed on the infrastructure subnet and accessible by fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or through an optional jumpbox. |
| **BOSH Director** | Deployed on the infrastructure subnet. |
| **Gorouters** | Accessed through the HTTP and TCP WebSockets load balancers. Deployed on the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> subnet, one job per AZ. |
| **Diego Brains** | Required. However, the SSH container access functionality is optional and enabled through the SSH Proxy load balancer. Deployed on the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> subnet, one job per AZ. |
| **TCP routers** | Optional feature for TCP routing. Deployed on the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> subnet, one job per AZ.|
| **Database** | Reference architecture uses GCP Cloud SQL rather than internal databases. Configure your database with a strong password and limit access only to components that require database access. |
| **Blob Storage and Buckets** | For buildpacks, droplets, packages, and resources. Reference architecture uses Google Cloud Storage rather than internal file storage. |
| **Services** | Deployed on the managed services subnet. Each service is deployed to each AZ. |

### <a id="common_network"></a> Alternative GCP Network Layouts

This section describes the possible network layouts for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployments as covered by the reference architecture of <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP.

At a high level, there are currently two possible ways of granting public Internet access to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> as described by the reference architecture:

* NAT provides connectivity from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> internals to the public Internet.
	* The procedures in [Installing <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP](../../install/gcp-manual.html) use this method.

* Every VM receives its own public IP address (no NAT).

#### <a id="no_nat"></a> Public IP Addresses Solution

If you prefer not to use a NAT solution, you can configure <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> on GCP to assign public IP addresses for all components. This type of deployment may be more performant since most of the network traffic between <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components are routed through the front end load balancer and the Gorouter.

#### <a id="network_components"></a> Network Objects

The table below lists the network objects expected for each type of reference architecture deployment with three AZs (assumes you are using NAT).

| **Network Object** | **Notes** | **Minimum Number: NAT-Based** | **Minimum Number: Public IP Addresses** |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **External IPs** | For a NAT solution, use global IP address for apps and system access, and <%= vars.ops_manager %> or an optional jumpbox. | 2 | 30+ |
| **NAT** | One NAT per AZ. | 3 | 0 |
| **Network** | One per deployment. GCP Network objects allow multiple subnets with multiple CIDRs, so a typical deployment likely only ever requires one GCP Network object. | 1 | 1 |
| **Subnets** | Separate subnets for infrastructure (<%= vars.ops_manager %> VM, BOSH Director, jumpbox), <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, and services. Using separate subnets allows you to configure different firewall rules due to your needs. | 3 | 3 |
| **Routes** | Routes are typically created by GCP dynamically when subnets are created, but you may need to create additional routes to force outbound communication to dedicated SNAT nodes. These objects are required to deploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> without public IP addresses. | 3+ | 3|
| **Firewall Rules** | GCP firewall rules are bound to a Network object and can be created to use IP ranges, subnets, or instance tags to match for source and destination fields in a rule. The preferred method used in the reference architecture deployment is instance tags. | 6+ | 6+ |
| **Load balancers** | Used to handle requests to Gorouters and infrastructure components. GCP uses two or more load balancers. The HTTP load balancer and TCP WebSockets load balancer are both required. The TCP router load balancer used for TCP routing and the SSH load balancer that allows SSH access to Diego apps are both optional. The HTTP load balancer provides SSL termination. | 2+ | 2+ |
| **Jumpbox** | Optional. Provides a way of accessing different network components. For example, you can configure it with your own permissions and then set it up to access to VMware Tanzu Network to download tiles. Using a jumpbox is particularly useful in IaaSes where <%= vars.ops_manager %> does not have a public IP address. In these cases, you can SSH into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM or any other component through the jumpbox. | (1) | (1)|


## <a id="network_comm"></a> Network Communication in GCP Deployments

These sections provide more background on the reasons behind certain network configuration decisions, specifically for the Gorouter.

### <a id='lb-to-gorouter'></a> Load Balancer to Gorouter Communications and TLS Termination

In a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> on GCP deployment, the Gorouter receives two types of traffic:

* Unencrypted HTTP traffic on port 80 that is decrypted by the HTTP(S) load balancer.

* Encrypted secure web socket traffic on port 443 that is passed through the TCP WebSockets load balancer.

TLS is terminated for HTTPS on the HTTP load balancer and is terminated for WebSockets (WSS) traffic on the Gorouter.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployments on GCP use two load balancers to handle Gorouter traffic because HTTP load balancers currently do not support WebSockets.

### <a id='icmp'></a> ICMP

GCP routers do not respond to ICMP. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends disabling ICMP checks in your BOSH Director network configuration. For more information, see [Step 5: Create Networks Page](../../gcp/config-manual.html#network) in _Configuring BOSH Director on GCP_.

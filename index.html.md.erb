This topic introduces <%= vars.ops_manager %> (previously Pivotal <%= vars.ops_manager %> or PCF <%= vars.ops_manager %>) and describes how to get started.


## <a id="overview"></a> About <%= vars.ops_manager %>

<%= vars.ops_manager %> is a software tool to help you expand and manage products you can install on your deployment. These products are represented as a _tile_ in the UI.

<%= vars.ops_manager %> deploys with the BOSH Director tile by default, which is a single point of control for VMs. The BOSH Director supports various IaaSes, including AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack, and vSphere.

With <%= vars.ops_manager %>, you can install two types of tiles:

- **Runtime Tiles:** You can install VM- or Kubernetes-based runtimes, which dynamically runs apps and other processes to balance demand throughout app lifecycles. Example runtimes managed though <%= vars.ops_manager %> include <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

- **Service Tiles:** You can install various services that help support your deployment. Example types of services managed through <%= vars.ops_manager %> include MySQL, Redis, and Gemfire.

For more information about the tiles you can install, see [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/).



## <a id="responsibilities"></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> Responsibilities

<%= vars.ops_manager %> is managed by an _operator_. The operator is responsible for installing and maintaining runtime and service tiles.

### <a id="operator"></a> Operator Responsibilities

* Configuring <%= vars.ops_manager %> capabilities

* Integrating <%= vars.ops_manager %> with external systems

* Updating <%= vars.ops_manager %> and installed products

* Monitoring <%= vars.ops_manager %> health and performance

* Adjusting <%= vars.ops_manager %> resources and options to fix health or performance issues

* Diagnosing and troubleshooting <%= vars.ops_manager %> problems

* Managing <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) users, resources, and infrastructure

* Installing software services and otherwise enabling developers

* Creating and managing <%= vars.ops_manager %> user and client accounts


### <a id=""></a> Limited-Access Operator Responsibilities

Operators can give limited-access view or write <%= vars.ops_manager %> responsibilites to others within an organization.

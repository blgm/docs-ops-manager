This topic describes how to disable and re-enable verifiers for fields in the BOSH
Director and other product tiles.

Ops Manager provides this option for troubleshooting
purposes. For example, your deployment may have a unique configuration that the
verifier cannot detect. In this case, you can unblock your deployment by disabling the verifier.

## <a id="about-verifiers"></a> About Verifiers

Ops Manager verifiers narrow the feedback loop for operators by checking that fields are
configured correctly. Ops Manager verifiers reach out and find objects in the world. For example, given an IP, a
verifier can ping the IP to see that it responds.

Verifiers run early in a deployment. With verifiers turned off,
deployments may fail much later.

Verifiers run on two occasions:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Verifier Label</th>
    <th>Triggers when you...</th>
    <th>Blocks deployment?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>form</code></td>
    <td>Click <strong>Save</strong> in a pane.</td>
    <td>Does not block deployment. Error message is a warning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>install_time</code></td>
    <td>Click <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</td>
    <td>Blocks you from deploying. Disabling verifiers unblocks deployment.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## <a id="disable"></a> Disable Verifiers by Type

You can disable verifiers by verifier type. For example, you can disable all MySQL
verifiers for a tile. To disable a verifier type for a tile, you
must find and record the type, then use the Ops Manager API.

### <a id="record-type"></a> Step 1: Record the Verifier Type

To record the verifier type, do the following:

1. Log in to Ops Manager and go to **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** and see the verifier error message.

1. Record the `type` in the verifier error message. For example,
`WildcardDomainVerifier`.

<%= image_tag("images/verifier-error.png", :alt=>"The Ops Manager screenshot shows the following
	      error: The domain '*.apps.example.com' failed to resolve,
	      type:WildcardDomainVerifier") %>

### <a id="api-put"></a> Step 2: Use the Ops Manager API

To disable verifiers, you must use the Ops Manager API. To get started with
the Ops Manager API, follow the procedures in [Using the Ops Manager API](./ops-man-api.html).

The API endpoint varies by tile. Go to one of the procedures below:

- [Disable Verifiers for the Bosh Director Tile](#bosh-director-disable)

- [Disable Verifiers for Other Tiles](#tile-disable)

#### <a id="bosh-director-disable"></a> Disable Verifiers for the BOSH Director Tile

To disable a verifier type for the BOSH Director, do the following:

1. Run the following API command:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/VERIFER-TYPE" \
     -X PUT \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "enabled": false }'
     ```

    Where:
    - `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.
    - `VERIFIER-TYPE` is the verifier type you recorded in [Step 1: Record the Verifier Type
](#verifier-type).
    - `UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN` is your UAA access token. For more information, see [Access the
    API](./ops-man-api.html#access-api).

    For more information about this endpoint, see [Turning off a verifier for the
    director](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#turning-off-a-verifier-for-the-director)
    in the Ops Manager API documentation.

1. To confirm your verifier type is disabled, run the following command:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time" \
     -X GET \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    ```

    See that the Ops Manager API shows `false` for the verifier type you disabled. In
    the following example, `DirectorConfigurationVerifer` is set to `false`:
    <pre class="terminal" style="height: 300px; scroll: auto;">
{
  "verifiers": [
    {
      "type": "AllocatedIpAddressVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "AvailabilityZonesVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "DirectorConfigurationVerifier",
      "enabled": false
    },
    {
      "type": "IaasConfigurationVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "NetworksExistenceVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "NetworksPingableVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "PrivilegeVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    }]}
</pre>

    For more information about this endpoint, see [Retrieving a list of install time
    verifiers for a specific
    product](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#retrieving-a-list-of-install-time-verifiers-for-a-specific-product)
    in the Ops Manager API documentation.

1. Record the product and the verifier type that you disabled in a secure location.
<%= vars.company_name %> recommends recording and routinely revisiting which verifiers you disable.


#### <a id="tile-disable"></a> Disable Verifiers for Other Tiles

To disable a verifier type for tiles other than the BOSH Director, do the following:

1. Run the following command and record the `guid` corresponding to your product.

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products" \
    -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```
    Where:
    - `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.
    - `UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN` is your UAA access token. For more information, see [Access the
    API](./ops-man-api.html#access-api).



    See the following example output:
    <pre class="terminal">{[{
      "installation_name": "component-type1-installation-name",
      "guid": "component-type1-guid",
      "type": "component-type1"
  },
  {
      "installation_name": "p-bosh-installation-name",
      "guid": "p-bosh-guid",
      "type": "p-bosh"
    }]}</pre>
    For more information about this endpoint, see [Listing all staged
    products](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#listing-all-staged-products)
    in the Ops Manager API documentation.

1. To disable your verifier by type, run the following command.

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products/PRODUCT-GUID/verifiers/install_time/VERIFIER-TYPE" \
    -X PUT \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "enabled": false }'
    ```

    Where:
    - `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.
    - `PRODUCT-GUID` is the GUID you recorded in the previous step.
    - `VERIFIER-TYPE` is the verifier type you recorded in [Step 1: Record the Verifier Type
](#verifier-type).

    For more information about this endpoint, see [Turning off a verifier for a specific
    product](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#turning-off-a-verifier-for-a-specific-product)
    in the Ops Manager API documentation.

1. To confirm your verifier type is disabled, run the following command.

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products/PRODUCT-GUID/verifiers/install_time" \
    -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    See that the Ops Manager API shows `false` for the verifier type you disabled. In
    the following example, `MysqlDatabaseVerifier` is set to `false`:
    <pre class="terminal" style="height: 300px; scroll: auto;">{
      "verifiers":[
      {
	  "type":"BlobstoreVerifier",
	  "enabled":true
	},
	{
	  "type":"MysqlDatabaseVerifier",
	  "enabled":false
	},
	{
	  "type":"SsoUrlVerifier",
	  "enabled":true
	},
	{
	  "type":"WildcardDomainVerifier",
	  "enabled":true
	}]}</pre>

    For more information about this endpoint, see [Retrieving a list of install time
    verifiers for a specific
    product](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#retrieving-a-list-of-install-time-verifiers-for-a-specific-product100)
    in the Ops Manager API documentation.

1. Record the product and the verifier type that you disabled in a secure location.
<%= vars.company_name %> recommends recording and routinely revisiting which verifiers you disable.

## <a id="re-enable"></a> Re-enable Verifiers by Type

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends recording and routinely revisiting which verifiers you disable.
The Ops Manager UI does not indicate which verifiers you disable. Disabled verifiers
persist through upgrades.

To re-enable verifiers, follow the steps detailed in [Use the Ops Manager API](#api-put)
above. Instead of setting `enabled` to `false`, set it to `true`.

If you do not know what verifiers are disabled, `curl` the `verifiers` endpoint for each
installed product. For more information, see [Retrieving a list of install time verifiers
for a specific
product](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#retrieving-a-list-of-install-time-verifiers-for-a-specific-product100)
in the Ops Manager API documentation.

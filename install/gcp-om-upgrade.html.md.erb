<%= partial "/pcf/core/2-10/om_upgrade_overview" %>

To create an <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance:

1. Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file. For more information, see [Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation File](#select-tgz).

1. Create a private VM image. For more information, see [Create a Private VM Image](#create-image).

1. Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. For more information, see [Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM Instance](#start-vm).


## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

<%# Find this partial in GitHub at `pivotal-cf/docs-partials` %>
<%= partial "/pcf/core/2-10/om_upgrade_prerequisite" %>

## <a id='select-tgz'></a> Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation File

The <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file includes a filepath to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image. You use this image file to create a private VM image for the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

To locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file:

1. Log in to [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and click on **<%= vars.ops_manager %>**.

1. From the **Releases** dropdown, select the release for your upgrade.

1. Select one of the following download files:
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> for GCP**
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> YAML for GCP**
    When you click on the download link, your browser downloads or opens the <code>OpsManager\_<em>version</em>\_onGCP.pdf</code> or <code>OpsManager\_<em>version</em>\_onGCP.yml</code> file. <br/><br/>
    These documents provide the GCP location of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> `.tar.gz` installation file based on the geographic location of your installation.

1. Copy the filepath string of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image based on your existing deployment location.


## <a id="create-image"></a> Create a Private VM Image

Create a private VM image to use when you create the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

To create a private VM image:

1. Log in to the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

1. In the left navigation panel, click **Compute Engine**, and select **Images**.

1. Click **Create Image**.

1. Complete the following fields:
  * **Name:** Enter a name that matches the naming convention of your existing <%= vars.ops_manager %> image files.
  * **Encryption:** Leave **Automatic (recommended)** selected.
  * **Source:** Choose **Cloud Storage file**.
  * **Cloud Storage file:** Paste in the Google Cloud Storage filepath you copied from the PDF or YAML file in the previous task.
      <%= image_tag("images/gcp/create_image.png", :alt => "Screenshot of the GCP console page titled 'Create an image'. The fields are shown completed with example values.") %>

1. Click **Create**. The file may take a few minutes to import.


## <a id="start-vm"></a> Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM Instance

Create an <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance to host the new version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

To create an <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance:

1. Select the checkbox for the image that you created above.

    <%= image_tag("images/gcp/create_instance.png", :alt => "Screenshot of the GCP console. The page shows the image created in the previous step selected with the name, size, created by, and creation time fields populated.") %>

1. Click **Create Instance**.

1. In the **Create an instance form**, complete the following fields:
  * **Name:** Enter a name that matches the naming conventions of your existing deployment.
  * **Zone:** Choose a zone from the region of your existing deployment.
  * **Machine type:** Click **Customize** to manually configure the vCPU and memory. An <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance requires the following minimum specifications:

        | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
        |------------------|----------------------|
        |CPU |2&nbsp;vCPUs |
        |Memory| 8&nbsp;GB |
  * **Boot disk:** Click **Change**, then perform the following steps:
     * Click **Custom images** if it is not already selected.
     * Select the **Boot disk type**. If you have an <%= vars.ops_manager %> environment with high performance needs, select **SSD**. As an example, environments used to develop <%= vars.ops_manager %> tiles may benefit from a higher performing <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM boot disk. For most environments, however, you can select **Standard**.
     * Set the **Size (GB)** of the boot disk to the minimum or higher.

            | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
            |------------------|----------------------|
            |Boot disk|100&nbsp;GB|
     * Select the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image you created in the previous step if it is not already selected.<br>
        <%= image_tag("images/gcp/boot_image.png", :alt => "Screenshot of the page titled 'Boot disk'. The Ops Manager image is selected.") %>
     * Click **Select** to save.
  * Under **Identity and API access**, choose the **Service account** you created when you initially installed <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Step 1: Set up IAM Service Accounts](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_.
  * **Allow HTTP traffic:** Only select this checkbox if you selected it in your original <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM configuration.
  * **Allow HTTPS traffic:** Only select this checkbox if you selected it in your original <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM configuration.<br/>
        <%= image_tag("images/gcp/om_instance_1.png", :alt => "Screenshot of the Ops Manager VM configuration page. The fields show an example configuration.") %>
  * **Networking:** Select the **Networking** tab and do the following:
     * For **Network** and **Subnetwork**, select the network and subnetwork you created when you initially deployed <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Step 3: Create a GCP Network with Subnets](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#create_network) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_.
     * For **Network tags**, enter any tags that you applied to your original <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For example, if you used the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-opsmanager` tag to apply the firewall rule you created in [Step 5: Create Firewall Rules for the Network](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#firewall_rules) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_, then apply the same tag to this <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.
     * For **Internal IP**, select `Custom`. In the **Internal IP address** field, enter a spare address located within the reserved IP range you configured in your existing BOSH Director as part of [Step 5: Create Networks Page](../gcp/config-manual.html#network) in _Configuring BOSH Director on GCP_. Do not use `10.0.0.1`, which is configured for the Gateway.
     * For **External IP**, select **New static IP address...**. In the next form, enter a name for the static IP. For example, `om-public-ip`. Click **Reserve**. In the **External IP** dropdown, select the static IP address you just reserved.
        <%= image_tag("images/gcp/instance_networking.png", :alt => "Screenshot of Ops Manager VM configuration 'Networking' tab. The fields show an example configuration.") %>

1. Click **Create** to deploy the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. This may take a few moments.

1. Navigate to your DNS provider, and modify the entry that points a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. Replace the original <%= vars.ops_manager %> static IP address with the public IP address of the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM you created in a previous step.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> In order to set up <%= vars.ops_manager %> authentication correctly, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using a FQDN to access <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Using an ephemeral IP address to access <%= vars.ops_manager %> can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access. If you are importing older <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings, you must use the FQDN.</p>


## <a id="next"></a> Next Steps

After you complete this procedure, continue the upgrade instructions in [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](./upgrading-pcf.html).

Later on, if you need to SSH into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM to perform diagnostic troubleshooting, see [Log Into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM with SSH](./ssh-login.html#ssh-by-iaas).

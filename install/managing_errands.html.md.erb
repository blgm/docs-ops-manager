title: Managing Errands in Ops Manager
owner: Ops Manager

This topic describes product errands used in <%= vars.ops_manager %> and how to configure them.

Errands are scripts that can run at the beginning and at the end of an installed productâ€™s availability time.
You can use Ops Manager to adjust whether and when these errands run.

Product tiles include two types of errands:

* **Post-deploy errands** run after the product installs but before Ops Manager makes the product available for use. One example is an errand that publishes a newly-installed service to the Services Marketplace.
* **Pre-delete errands** run after an operator chooses to delete the product but before Ops Manager actually deletes it. One example is a clean-up task that removes all data objects used by the errand.

When you click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** in Ops Manager, BOSH either creates a VM for each errand that runs or co-locates errands on existing VMs.
Tile developers determine where BOSH deploys the errands for their product.

<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> provides several post-deploy errands including smoke tests, Apps Manager, notification, <%= vars.ops_manager %> Account, and autoscaling errands. For more information about <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> errands, see [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/configure-pas.html).

For information about the errands associated with any other <%= vars.ops_manager %> product, see the documentation provided with the product tile.


## <a id="rules"></a> Errand Run Rules

Operators can configure two different run rules for errands: **On** and **Off**. These rules control when Ops Manager executes the errand.

When the errand is configured to be **On**, then it always runs, even if there are no changes to the product manifest. When the errand is configured to be **Off**, it never runs.

### <a id="defaults"></a> Ops Manager Defaults and Tile Defaults

By default, Ops Manager applies the **On** rule to all  errands.

For any errand, the tile developer can override these Ops Manager defaults with their own tile-specific defaults defined in the tile [property blueprints](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/property-reference.html#property-blueprints).


## <a id="modify"></a> Configure Run Rules in Ops Manager

You can configure the run rules for errands in two places in Ops Manager. The [Errands](#errands_pane) pane saves your configuration and applies the configuration to future installations. The [Pending Changes](#changes-view) view applies the rules only to the next time you run an Ops Manager install, without saving them.

### <a id="errands-pane"></a> Errands Pane: Persistent Rules

Product tiles for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and other <%= vars.ops_manager %> products have an **Errands** pane that configures the run rules for the product's errands and saves the settings for later.

The **Errands** pane lists all errands for the product and lets you select **On** or **Off**. The [default](#defaults) option differs depending on the errand, and reflects the default setting used by Ops Manager for the errand or any tile-specific default that overrides it.

To configure the run rules for a tile, do the following:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager and click the tile to open it.

1. Under the **Settings** tab, open the **Errands** pane.

1. Use the dropdowns to configure the run rule choice for each errand: **On** or **Off**.

1. Click **Save** to save the configuration values and return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to redeploy the tile with the new settings.

### <a id="changes-view"></a> Pending Changes: One-Time Rules

Ops Manager lets you quickly configure one-time errand run rules for any product queued up for installation:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager. The **Pending Changes** section at top right shows products that Ops Manager has yet to install or update.

1. Under **Pending Changes**, click the product you wish to configure. A list of errands associated with the product appears.

1. Use the dropdowns to configure the [run rule](#rules) choice for each errand: **On** or **Off**. Ops Manager applies these settings once you click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to install the product, but does not save the settings for future installations.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to redeploy the tile.

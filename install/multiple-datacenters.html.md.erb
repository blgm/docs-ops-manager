This topic describes how you can add, delete, and modify multiple data centers in the IaaS config pane of the BOSH Director tile. This allows you to spread instances across regions without having to deploy and manage multiple <%= vars.ops_manager %> foundations.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You can only have multiple data centers with vSphere and OpenStack.</p>


## <a id="add-config"></a> Add a New IaaS Config

When you have only one IaaS config, you do not see a list of IaaS configs when you select the IaaS configs pane. Instead, you see the form to the one config and an option to add more.

To add a new IaaS config, do the following:

1. Click **Add vCenter Config** or **Add OpenStack Config**.
  <%= image_tag("images/vcenters-buttons.png", :alt => "The 'Add vCenter Config' button is located to the right of the 'vCenter Config' header. The first field below is titled 'Name', indicated required with an asterisk. In the field, there is a unique name entered, 'first-vcenter'.") %>

1. Enter a unique **Name** for your config.

1. Complete the rest of the form.
  - For more information about the fields in vSphere, see _Step 2: Configure vCenter_ in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../vsphere/config.html#vcenter-config).

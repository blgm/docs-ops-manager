For <%= vars.ops_manager %> installations on AWS, the VM that hosts the new version of <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) specific to your region.

To create an <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance:

1. Retrieve the <%= vars.ops_manager %> AMI ID. For more information, see [Retrieve <%= vars.ops_manager %> AMI ID](#pcfaws-om-ami) below.

1. Launch the AMI. For more information, see [Launch <%= vars.ops_manager %> AMI](#pcfaws-om-ami) below.

1. Edit the <%= vars.ops_manager %> DNS A Record. For more information, see [Edit <%= vars.ops_manager %> DNS A Record](#dns) below.

<%= partial "./om_upgrade_prerequisite" %>

## <a id='pcfaws-om-ami'></a> Retrieve <%= vars.ops_manager %> AMI ID

<%= vars.ops_manager %> has a different AMI ID for each region. Retrieve and record the AMI ID for your region. You use this AMI ID when launching the <%= vars.ops_manager %> AMI instance.

To retrieve the AMI ID for <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

1. Navigate to the [<%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) page on VMware Tanzu Network.

1. Select the version of <%= vars.ops_manager %> you want to install from the **Releases** dropdown.

1. In the **Release Download Files**, click the file named **<%= vars.ops_manager %> for AWS** to download a PDF.

1. Open the PDF and record the AMI ID for your region.


## <a id='pcfaws-om-ami'></a> Launch <%= vars.ops_manager %> AMI

Use the AMI ID for your region to launch an AMI instance that hosts the new version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

To launch the AMI for <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

1. Navigate to your EC2 Dashboard.

1. Click **AMIs** from the **Images** menu.

1. Select **Public images** from the dropdown filter that says **Owned by me**.

1. Paste the AMI ID for your region into the search bar and press enter.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> There is a different AMI for each region. If you cannot locate the AMI for your region, verify that you have set your AWS Management Console to your desired region. If you still cannot locate the AMI, log in to the VMware Tanzu Network and file a support ticket.</p>

1. (Optional) If you want to encrypt the VM that runs <%= vars.ops_manager %> with AWS Key Management Service (KMS):
  1. Right-click the row that lists your AMI and click **Copy AMI**.
  1. Select your **Destination region**.
  1. Enable **Encryption**. For more information about AMI encryption, see [Encryption and AMI Copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html#ami-copy-encryption) in _Copying an AMI_ in the AWS documentation.
  1. Select your **Master Key**. To create a new custom key, see [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the AWS documentation.
  1. Click **Copy AMI**. You can use the new AMI you copied for the next steps.

1. Select the row that lists your <%= vars.ops_manager %> AMI and click **Launch**.

1. Choose **m5.large** for your instance type.

1. Click **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

1. Configure the following fields for your instance:
    * **Network:** Select the VPC that you created.
    * **Subnet:** Select `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-public-subnet-az0`.
    * **Auto-assign for Public IP:** Select **Enable**.
    * **IAM role:** Select the IAM role associated with your <%= vars.product_name_lc %>-user profile. If you have not created one, click **Create new IAM role** and follow the procedures in [AWS Permissions Guidelines](aws-iaas-user-roles.html).
    * For all other fields, accept the default values.

1. Click **Next: Add Storage**.

1. Adjust the **Size (GiB)** value. The default persistent disk value is 50&nbsp;GB. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends increasing this value to a minimum of 100&nbsp;GB.

1. Click **Next: Tag Instance**

1. On the **Add Tags** page, add a tag with the key `Name` and value `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-ops-manager`.

1. Click **Next: Configure Security Group**.

1. Select the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-ops-manager-security-group` that you created in [Configure a Security Group for <%= vars.ops_manager %>](../aws/prepare-env-manual.html#pcfaws-om-secgrp) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on AWS_.

1. Click **Review and Launch** and confirm the instance launch details.

1. Click **Launch**.

1. Select the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-ops-manager-key` key pair, confirm that you have access to the private key file, and click **Launch Instances**. You use this key pair to access the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.


## <a id='dns'></a> Edit <%= vars.ops_manager %> DNS A Record

After you deploy the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM, edit the <%= vars.ops_manager %> DNS record in the EC2 dashboard to point to the IP address for the new VM.

To edit the <%= vars.ops_manager %> DNS A record:

1. Click **View Instances** to access the **Instances** page on the EC2 Dashboard.

1. Select the VM that you created in the previous section.

1. Locate the **IPv4 Public IP** value in the instance **Description** tab, and record this value for use in the next step.

1. In your DNS provider, edit the **A** record for `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>.SYSTEM-DOMAIN` to point to the IP address recorded in the previous step, where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.


## <a id='continue'></a> Next Steps

After you complete this procedure, continue to the upgrade instructions in [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](upgrading-pcf.html)

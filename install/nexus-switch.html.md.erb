Refer to the procedure in this topic to use <%= vars.ops_manager %> with the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch. First, configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> through Step 4 in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../vsphere/config.html). Then configure your network according to the following steps.

1. From your [<%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) <%= vars.ops_manager %> **Installation Dashboard**, click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Click the network name to configure the network settings. This is **default** if you have not changed the name.

1. Find the folder name and port group name for the switch, as you configured them in vCenter. For the example vSphere environment pictured below, a user might want to use the switch configured on the `beer-apple` port group, which is in the `drinks dc` folder.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Folder names can be strings of multiple words separated by spaces, or strings of words separated by other punctuation, including dashes.</p>

1. In the **vSphere Network Name** field, instead of entering your network name, enter the folder name and port group name for the switch, as you configured them in vCenter. For the example vSphere environment pictured above, you would enter `drinks dc/beer-apple` to use the switch configured on the `beer-apple` port group.

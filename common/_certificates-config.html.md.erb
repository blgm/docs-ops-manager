For **Certificate Duration Overrides**, you can choose whether certificates generated within Ops Manager and CredHub use the default duration specified for the certificate or a custom duration value that you specify.
  <%= image_tag src="../common/images/duration-overrides.png" %>
  * **Off:** Select this option to use default duration for certificates created by all products.
  * **On:** Select this option to set a value to override the duration for certificates created by all products. If a product creates a certificate with a longer duration than the value you set, then the longer duration is used.
        1. **CA Certificate Duration (days):** Enter the number of days for which CA certificates are valid.
        1. **Leaf Certificate Duration (days):** Enter the number of days for which leaf certificates are valid. This value must be less than or equal to the CA certificate duration.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After you set a certificate duration override, you must take additional steps to apply the setting to all certificates.

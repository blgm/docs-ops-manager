This topic covers how to set trusted certificates in the BOSH Director tile of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.

and IaaS-specific Ops Manager configuration topics. %>

1. Navigate to the BOSH Director tile from the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Select **Security**.

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter your custom certificate authority (CA) certificates to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust custom root certificates.
  <br><br>To enter multiple certificates, paste your certificates one after the other. For example, format your certificates like the example below:
  <pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678AB
EFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEF
GH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678...
------END CERTIFICATE------
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
BCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABB
EFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEF
GH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678...
------END CERTIFICATE------
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
CDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABBB
EFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEF
GH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678...
------END CERTIFICATE------</pre>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to use Docker registries to run <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> app instances in Docker containers, enter the certificate for your private Docker registry in this field. For more information about running app instances in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> using Docker registries, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/docker-registry.html">Using Docker Registries</a>.</p>

1. To include the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA in the **Trusted Certificates** field, select the **Include OpsManager Root CA in Trusted Certs** checkbox. BOSH Director includes this CA in the trust store of every VM that it deploys.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you are using Ops Manager to generate certificates for either a load balancer or router, then you must select this checkbox.</p>

1. To clear the default trusted certificates from all BOSH-deployed Linux VMs, select the **Clear the Default Trusted Certificates Store** checkbox. You must provide your own trusted certificates when selecting this checkbox as all TLS communication fails without trusted certificates available.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This option is available in Ops Manager v2.10.21 and later.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='certificates'></a> Certificates Page

Navigate to the **Certificates** page by clicking the corresponding link in the dashboard header.
This page shows the certificates in your Ops Manager installation.

The following image shows the top section of the **Certificates** page:

![Certificates' menu page is indicated by a header that says 'Certificates' in large type at the top of the page. Below the header, there is one line of text that reads,
'The following certificates will be rotated using Ops Manager API.
To view the certificates that will not be rotated, click here.
To get started, please visit the documentation.'
Below the text, there is a table with six columns.
The columns are labeled, from left to right, 'Certificate name', 'Product GUID', 'Location', 'Type', 'Configurable', and 'Valid until'.
Below the column headers are two rows that contain example values.
Under 'Certificate name', the first example is '/p-bosh/example-product-864b7cc671f9590a0b6f/generated-certificate-migrated-to-credhub' and the second example is '/bosh_dns_health_client_tls'.
Under 'Product GUID', both example values are 'example-product-864b7cc671f9590a0b6f'.
Under 'Location', both example values are 'credhub'.
Under 'Type', the first example is 'CA' and the second example is 'Leaf'.
Under 'Configurable', both example values are 'No'.
Under 'Valid until', the both example values are 'July 7, 2021' and in bold text on the next line, 'in 364 days'.](images/certificates.png)

The top section of the **Certificates** page includes the certificates that the Ops Manager API attempts to rotate.
This section includes both certificates that the Ops Manager API can rotate and certificates that you must rotate manually.

For information about how to rotate these certificates, see [Overview of Certificate Rotation](security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).

The following describes the information listed on the **Certificates** page:

+ **Certificate name**: the name of the certificate.
+ **Product GUID**: the product name with its unique identifier.
+ **Location**: whether CredHub or Ops Manager stores and manages the certificate.
+ **Type**: a certificate authority (CA) or leaf certificate.
+ **Configurable**: whether or not you can configure the certificate.
If a certificate is configurable, you can generate your own and paste it into Ops Manager configuration panes.
+ **Valid until**: the date that the certificate expires.

The following image shows the **Excluded certificates** section of the **Certificates** page:

![The 'Excluded certificates' section has a header that says 'Excluded certificates' in large type at the top of the section. Below the header, there is one line of text that reads,
'The following certificates will not be rotated using Ops Manager API.
Please follow the guidelines in our documentation.'
Below the text, there is a table with six columns.
The columns are labeled, from left to right, 'Certificate name', 'Product GUID', 'Location', 'Type', 'Configurable', and 'Valid until'.
Below the column headers are two rows that contain example values.
Under 'Certificate name', the first example is '/foo/service-instance_3/pxc_4' and the second example is '/bazz/service-instance_7/redis_certificate'.
Under 'Product GUID', both example values are 'example-product-864b7cc671f9590a0b6f'.
Under 'Location', both example values are 'credhub'.
Under 'Type', both example values are 'CA'.
Under 'Configurable', both example values are 'No'.
Under 'Valid until', the both example values are 'July 7, 2021' and in bold text on the next line, 'in 364 days'.](images/excluded-certificates.png)

The **Excluded certificates** section includes the certificates that the Ops Manager API does not attempt to rotate, because they either must be rotated using the CredHub Maestro CLI or cannot be rotated safely at all.

The Services TLS CA and its leaf certificates must be rotated using the CredHub Maestro CLI. To rotate the Services TLS CA certificate and its leaf certificates, see [Rotate the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates](security/pcf-infrastructure/advanced-certificate-rotation.html#services-rotation) in _Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro_.

For all other certificates listed in **Excluded certificates**, see the documentation for the product tile associated with the non-rotatable certificate or contact [Support](https://tanzu.vmware.com/support).
